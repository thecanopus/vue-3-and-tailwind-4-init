# Vue 3 and Tailwind CSS v4

This is a base Vue3/Vite/TailwindCSS project with most of the init work done.

## What's included in the box?

- Vue 3
- TailwindCSS 4
- Vite
- Vitest
- TypeScript (Optional usage)
- Vue Router
- Pinia
- ESLint
- Prettier

> Tip: I've toned down ESLint on Typescript but if you want it to be more agressive (`essential`, `recommended` instead of `base`), change the two lines regarding `pluginVue.configs` and `vueTsConfigs`
